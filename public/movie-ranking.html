 <p>We have all been in that situation at the airport terminal, endless hours of waiting and delays. Now its finally time, you're invited to board the flight. But, uh oh, what this? A crying baby and a smelly neck beard guy!?
 Ugh, come on!! Well, have i got the solution for you, welcome to the worlds greatest list of: Films for Fun Flights!
 let your woes melt away, into the bliss of cinema magic.</p>

 <h4>Spirted Away</h4>

 <p>what a marvelous movies this is, full of fun, adventure and emotional waves.
    Fun fact: This was the first anime I have ever watched, and its my favorite to this day</p>

 <h4>AntMan</h4>
 <p>I know.. i know. Out of all of the Marvel movies, this is the one you chose?
 Hear me out, its a bit of an underdog movie and thats why its so great. Who doesnt love a story about a guy down on his luck, working hard and life smiles upon him and things turn around for the best.
 If youre the kind of person who doesnt like that, email me, ill overnight FedEx you a hug. Clearly your mom didnt give you enough of those.</p>

 <h4>Blind Picking</h4>
 <p>What movie is this? Ah, you caught me. It's not a movie, sorta. ill explain.
 throughout my life, one of my absolute favorite ways to order food at a restaurant is to tell the server: "surprise me please."
 this is usually met with a bit of confusion and anxiety, but i cant remember one time, at least in America, where i didnt love what was brought to me.
 The item brought to me, i would have never ordered on my own, doing things this way has expanded my pallet. With that, literally close your eyes, scroll, and randomly tap on the screen.
 You can also ask your neighbor to pick one for you. Yes, i know human interaction is scary and talking to a stranger is a BIG thing, "stranger danger."
 But i promise, it will be fine. Either way, you'll come out of this with a fun story to tell.</p>

<h5>P.S. Have some wine</h5>

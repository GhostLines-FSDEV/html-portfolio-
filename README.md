# html-portfolio-
Switching into FSD coming from Emergency Medicine, this is my first project using HTML only
I learned a lot about the code base, how to stack, organize, debug and troubleshoot
I used HTMLin Viaual Studio
The overall project went smoothly, thanks to a fairly simplistic code base
Switching over from python made somethings tricky due to formatting </a> vs <a/>. That was the main learning point
